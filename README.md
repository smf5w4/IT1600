1. To install WireShark, you must go to their website and find the download for your specific OS. If you're on Windows, then you will want to select 'Windows Installer 64 bit'. [WireShark -Download](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html). Once you have downloaded the Installer, the setup window will appear. Click 'Next' until the application starts to install.
