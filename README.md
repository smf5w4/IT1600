Getting Started with WireShark: Install and Getting Started

By: Sean Fetz

WireShark is the go-to application to capture and inspect network traffic. In this tutorial I will show you how to install WireShark, as well as get started with your first packet trace. This tutorial is done on the Windows OS.

Hopefully this will help new users to WireShark get setup and get a inside look of what the application actually does. This tutorial is for new/beginner users to the app of any age or demographic.
